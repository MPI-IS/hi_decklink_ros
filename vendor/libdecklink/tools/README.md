# Re-generating the enumerations

The enumrations in `include/libdecklink/types.hpp` were generated by `mkenum` a code generator that reads a `yaml` configuration file and outputs C++ code. 

It generates the enums and a set of conversion methods. 

Should you change the enumerations, instead of changing them manually, change the configuration file `decklink_enums.yaml` and regenerate the enums by calling the `generate_enums script in this folder.
